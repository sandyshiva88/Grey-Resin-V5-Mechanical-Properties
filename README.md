# Grey-Resin-V5-Mechanical-Properties
This is my second GitHub repository focused on the experimental evaluation of mechanical properties of Grey Resin V5, a photopolymer resin used in SLA (Stereolithography) 3D printing. The study investigates the impact of 72-hour immersion in deionized water on the mechanical behavior of printed specimens.
